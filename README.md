## About The Project

One Voice is intended to be a PWA for providing cheap sound reinforcement on the go. It's inspired by and intended to be used for rallies and public demonstrations. Sound equipment is expensive and difficult to scale-up. This makes so many things difficult for community leaders working in outdoor spaces. A few of those challenges are: communicating directions and safety information, capturing and holding the attention of an audience, and keeping the voices and messaging centred on the demonstration.

Whether bluetooth speakers, car stereos or megaphones, so many people already own hardware which amplifies sound. Our goal is to provide a software solution which will allows people to tune into a broadcaster's message and lift it up. To best serve our leaders and their communities, we're working to keep these things in mind.

* Privacy
  * There have been concerns throughout 2020 that protestors and organizers put themselves at risk when participating with devices on network. We should work to protect users as much as possible.
* Portability
  * Traditionally audio equipment requires a considerable amount of time for set-up and tear-down. This is dangerous for both operators and equipment. Should a storm come hardware needs to move quick, and preferably still be used
* Scalability 
  * The more people show-up, the more equipment gets brought. One Voice should be easy to access and use, and be built with an understanding of the limits of sound in space.

### Proposed Technologies
* [React](https://reactjs.org/)
* [Webhooks](https://developer.github.com/webhooks/)
* Bluetooth
